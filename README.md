## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

For the first time I created a complex shape using only css (the mobile phone). I go deeper onto animation too, but I see the limits of CSS for that and I am considering to learn javascript. I manage quit well the display of my elements, I guess I learned a lot from my previous challenges

### Continued development

Just keep practicing, and maybe learn Js

### Useful resources

[mozilla docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - When I need to google something, I try to look for at this website, it seems complete to me.
